# Creation
I think of creating the project from scratch this time, because I like a minimalist approach but with a room for expantion.
- yarn init -y
to trach my steps so far
- git init
- git add .
- git commit -m "initial commit"
adding a new repo to my account using
- gh repo create

Start working on the primary server
- yarn add express nodemon cors
- will call the first route healthcheck
- adding a crude test and node-fetch 
- adding git ignore
